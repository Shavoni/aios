 Animal Care and Control Officer
 
 
 

 
 
 
Animal control officers (ACO) work to promote public safety by educating the community about animal safety, advocating for responsible pet ownership, and enforcing animal licensing laws and humane care regulations. Animal control officers often work with a variety of animals, including both pets and wildlife. ACOs are responsible for more than enforcing animal laws; they also assist law enforcement as the animal experts in their community, provide the services of social workers, risk their lives as emergency responders, mitigate community member conflicts, and much more. Although not traditionally classified as first responders, animal control officers ensure public safety for humans and animals.

**Qualifications:**

- Must be 18 years of age 
- High School Diploma or GED
- Must be a U.S. citizen
- Valid Ohio driver’s license (less than 6 points)

 Dispatcher
 
 
 

 
 
 
Dispatchers can make a difference by positively impacting community members when someone calls for help. They work as part of a team with diverse people with different backgrounds and experiences. The career is dynamic and never dull, as two calls are never the same. Every day every shift, and each caller brings a unique experience. Dispatchers play a crucial role in public safety as they are the first to speak with citizens when they call for help. The strength of dispatching is not only in supporting the community but supporting the other divisions of public safety in police, fire, EMS, and animal care and control.

**Qualifications:**

- Must be 18 years of age 
- High School Diploma or GED
- Must be a U.S. citizen
