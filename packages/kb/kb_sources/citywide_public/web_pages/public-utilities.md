## Overview

 
The Department of Public Utilities (DPU) was established by the Charter of the City of Cleveland and is responsible for the management and supervision of all city-owned public utilities. DPU is committed to providing our customers with reliable and affordable utility services and excellent customer service.

DPU is comprised of three major Divisions: Cleveland Public Power, Cleveland Water, and Water Pollution Control.

Cleveland Public Power, Cleveland Water, and Water Pollution Control are funded by customer rates, not tax revenue.

DPU also includes:

- The Division of Radio Communications, responsible for the maintenance of the City's 800 MHz radio system used by City divisions including Police, Fire, and EMS
- The Division of Fiscal Control, responsible for financial management of all divisions of DPU.
