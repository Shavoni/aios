# Welcome to the City of Cleveland

 
 
 
 
 
Cleveland is a city where entrepreneurial grit actually has a nice ring to it. Where world-changing breakthroughs meet genuine, hardworking people connected by the traditions we share, the opportunities we embrace, and the progress we seek. In other words, there’s no better place to live and work.

# Building Brighter Futures Starts Here

 
 
 
 
 
Cleveland Municipal School District's Building Brighter Futures is a strategic initiative to tackle a perfect storm of declining population, rising costs, and under-enrolled school buildings citywide. We’re reshaping CMSD schools to meet the needs of today and tomorrow for every scholar in every neighborhood.
