### 
 
 **
 
 
 Do I need a permit to do work on my own home?
 
 
 

 
 
 
While a permit is not needed to paint and perform minor maintenance or repairs, a residential permit is required to reroof, apply siding, install gutters, doors, and windows, or build decks, porches, and ramps. A residential permit is also required to finish basements and attics and to perform electrical, plumbing, and HVAC work. An Affadavit for a Homeowner’s Permit is required with each residential permit application.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
### 
 
 **
 
 
 How do I become a registered contractor in the City of Cleveland?
 
 
 

 
 
 
To register as an electrical, plumbing, or HVAC contractor, you must first be licensed by the State of Ohio. For information, call the Industry Licensing Board at 614.644.3493.

Then complete and submit the contractor packet that can be found on our [Resources Page](/city-hall/departments/building-housing/divisions/construction-permitting/resources).

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
### 
 
 **
 
 
 What should I do if I receive a building, housing, or zoning code violation notice?
 
 
 

 
 
 
To avoid prosecution and demolition (of condemned properties), all code violations must be corrected within 30 days. You have the right to appeal the violation notice at the Board of Building Standards, room 516 at Cleveland City Hall (601 Lakeside Ave). For more information on the appeal process, call 216.664.2418.
