## Department of Community Development

 
The Department of Community Development plays a vital role in shaping the future of the city of Cleveland, working with partners in the nonprofit, government, and philanthropy sectors to support the growth and vibrancy of our communities. 

Guided by our core values – collaboration, commitment, compassion, equity, and service – the Department envisions a Cleveland where stakeholders are empowered to build the pathway to equity. This vision is realized by creating quality housing and vibrant neighborhoods that serve as the foundation for generational wealth and community prosperity.

With programs ranging from the renovation of business storefronts to the management of the lead hazard reduction in all projects, the Department seeks to make Cleveland a better place to live, work, and invest.
